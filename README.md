## Project Motivation - 

Being a foodie myself , I want to explore different types of cuisines and new restaurants every saturday evening when we are free . Since bengaluru is a very large city , having over 56,000 restaurants and still newer ones coming up everyday , I decided to filter a dataset availaible to me from the kaggle site . After realising that the problem can't be solved dynamicallly in python , and that I would have to code again and again as per my different demands and moods , I realised that python packages alone weren't sufficient to solve my problems .

To tackle this problem , I decided to use Power BI , and make an interactive dashboard to solve this problem . Hope this solves the real life problems of other foodies too . 

## The Dataset :

The dataset is taken from the Kaggle site : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/himanshupoddar/zomato-bangalore-restaurants .

Note that the data is few years old , pre covid data , and updated data needs to be fed into the dashboard for more accurate insights .
